## Introduction

Apache Kafka is a powerful message broker designed for high-throughput and low-latency data streaming. It allows you to build real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. With Docker Compose, you can easily manage and deploy Kafka and its dependencies.

This repository aims to simplify the setup process. It provides a Docker Compose file that defines all necessary services, making it easy to get started with Kafka.

## Getting Started

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/poyraztuzcu/kafka-docker-compose.git
   cd kafka-docker-compose
   ```

2. **Download and execute the Docker Compose file:**

   You can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/poyraztuzcu/kafka-docker-compose/releases). Download the relevant files and execute them.

3. **Start the services:**

   Run the following command to start Kafka and its dependencies:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This command will set up the entire environment, including Zookeeper, Kafka, and any other necessary services.

## Project Structure

Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the project structure:

```
kafka-docker-compose/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml      # Main Docker Compose file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ express-app/            # Directory for the Express.js application
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js              # Main application file
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json        # Node.js dependencies
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...                 # Other application files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md               # Project documentation
```

- **docker-compose.yml:** This file defines the services, networks, and volumes for the Docker containers.
- **express-app/:** This directory contains the Express.js application, which will be used to interact with Kafka.

## Usage

After starting the services, you can access Kafka and Zookeeper through their respective ports. By default:

- Zookeeper runs on `localhost:2181`
- Kafka runs on `localhost:9092`

You can configure these ports in the `docker-compose.yml` file if needed.

To interact with Kafka, you can use various tools, such as:

- Kafka CLI tools
- Kafka clients in different programming languages
- The Express.js application provided in this repository

## Testing with Express.js

The Express.js application in this repository allows you to test Kafka by sending and receiving messages. Here‚Äôs how to set it up:

1. **Navigate to the Express app directory:**

   ```bash
   cd express-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Run the following command to install the necessary Node.js packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Express server:**

   Run the application with:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

   The server will start, and you can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Send a test message:**

   You can use a tool like Postman or curl to send a POST request to the Express app:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/send -d '{"message": "Hello, Kafka!"}'
   ```

   This will send a message to Kafka, and you should see a response confirming the message was sent.
